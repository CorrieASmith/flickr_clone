Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
  - Yeah pretty much no README but who does that anyway

Is there good spec coverage?
  - Well aside from not having any totally

Do all specs pass?
  - Well I guess we could say they do

Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
  - I would have to say yes

Is the site user-friendly?
  -Not particularly, just a few front end things we'd consider changing
  1. Putting a container over everything
  2. making it so that the pictures are links but not all the way across
  3. Not a whole lot of interaction opportunities, comments, tags etc

Are there opportunities for refactoring?

What features stand out?
  -the index organization looks nice
  -solid navbar
  -the south park characters

What features could be improved?
  :REFER TO the site user-friendly part

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
